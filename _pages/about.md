I am a first-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professors Moritz Hardt and Jacob Steinhardt. I'm broadly interested in ensuring that machine learning has positive social impact, from developing theoretical foundations for algorithmic fairness to empirical investigations into robustness of ML systems.
